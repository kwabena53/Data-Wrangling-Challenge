# Data-Wrangling-Challenge

## Objective

This is a simple script uses Nodejs to normalize the “European Union Road Safety Facts and Figures” table from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_safety_in_Europe). The script cleans the data and makes it very easy to process and conduct further analysis.

## How to run the Program on Your Computer

You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

Locate the path of the project and install the dependencies with the command below

```
git clone https://github.com/kwabena53/front-end-challenge.git
npm install or yarn install
```

Run the following command to start the app on your local service http://localhost:3000/

```
npm start or yarn start
```

### Input data
The input data was extracted raw from the “European Union Road Safety Facts and Figures” table on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_safety_in_Europe). This is can be found @ [data.csv](data.csv)

### Output data
The output data is the result of the data normalized data in CSV format found at [output.csv](output.csv)
